# skill-forge

A meta-skill that creates and evolves other skills. Uses persistent markdown files as
working memory (the planning-with-files pattern), an eval-driven iteration loop
(Anthropic's skill-creator pattern).

Workspace lives at `<project>/.skill-forge/` — a sibling of `.claude/`,
not inside it. Claude Code's trust boundary only exempts `.claude/commands/**`,
`.claude/agents/**`, and real skill dirs (those containing SKILL.md), so
any workspace under `.claude/` still prompts on Write under plugin-mode
installs where the local SKILL.md is absent. A project-root sibling has
no such constraint. Keeping workspace project-local also eliminates the
Python/shell slug-drift bugs from the pre-0.9 layout that stored workspace
under `$HOME` keyed by a hand-derived project slug.

- `.skill-forge/draft.md` — current skill being written (HIGH TRUST, re-read by hooks)
- `.skill-forge/insights.md` — raw codebase scan output (LOW TRUST, staging only)
- `.skill-forge/state.json` — per-project counters (tool_calls, compacted)
- `.skill-forge/staging/<name>/` — complete skill being assembled before it
  lands in `.claude/skills/<name>/`. `finalize_skill.py` copies it across via
  a Python subprocess, so Claude never Writes into a fresh `.claude/skills/<name>/`
  dir (which wouldn't yet qualify as a real skill dir and would prompt).

> Security: grep/glob output and codebase content go to insights.md only.
> draft.md is injected before every tool call, making it a prompt injection
> amplifier if contaminated. Promote content to the draft only after review.

---

## User-facing questions

Discrete choices (yes/no, pick-N, approve/revise) → `AskUserQuestion`. Load via
`ToolSearch select:AskUserQuestion` if missing. Plain text only for open-ended input.

---

## Phase 0 — context loading (always runs first)

Run the unified context loader (draft + catchup + skills list + registry):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/phase0_load.py"
```

Then note project conventions from CLAUDE.md.

---

## Mode dispatch

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- Empty / no args → **auto mode**
- `scan [prompt]` → **scan mode**
- `create <prompt>` → **create mode** (required)
- `improve <prompt>` → **improve mode** (required)

---

## Scan mode

Goal: surface 3–5 high-value skill opportunities from the codebase.
`$ARGUMENTS` is an optional free-form prompt used as focus hint (area, keyword, concern).

### Step 1: map structure

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/scan_structure.py"
```

If a focus prompt is given, prioritize that area during pattern discovery.

### Step 2: discover patterns (2-scan rule)

After every 2 file reads, append findings to `.skill-forge/insights.md`
via `Write` (not shell heredoc — heredoc shifts each call, Bash allowlist can't
match, non-bypass mode will prompt). Prevents loss if context fills up.

Block format:

```
## Scan batch <timestamp>
<pattern, files involved, why this could be a skill>
```

Also note: if multiple reads result in the same helper code appearing independently,
that's a strong signal to bundle a shared script rather than repeat it per-skill.

### Step 3: rank, present, and dispatch

Rank by: frequency × cost of repetition × feasibility as a skill.

Output format:

```
1. <n>  [complexity: low|med|high]
   Why: <one sentence — what pain does this solve?>
   Trigger: "Use when <specific, multi-step scenario>"
```

Ask via `AskUserQuestion` (multiSelect): one option per ranked skill + `All` + `Skip`.

**On the user's reply, jump straight into Create mode Step 1 for each chosen skill.**
Do not send a "shall I proceed" confirmation text — the answer already IS
the go-ahead, and the extra round-trip drops the user out of flow. If
multiple skills were picked, process them one at a time end-to-end
(Step 1 through Step 5) before starting the next — a half-created skill
cluttering staging is harder to recover from than sequential work.

---

## Create mode

Goal: draft a high-quality SKILL.md from a free-form prompt.

`$ARGUMENTS` describes what the skill should do. Derive a short kebab-case skill name
from the prompt automatically (e.g. "translate i18n JSON files" → `translate-i18n`).

### Step 1: initialize draft + staging

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/init_draft.py" "<derived-name>" "<$ARGUMENTS>"
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/init_staging.py" "<derived-name>"
```

The draft is the attention anchor the PreToolUse hook re-reads before
every tool call. The staging dir (`.skill-forge/staging/<n>/`) is where
the real skill files get assembled — we never Write directly into
`.claude/skills/<n>/` because a fresh dir there has no SKILL.md yet and
so fails the trust-boundary exemption, prompting even under YOLO.

### Step 2: gather context → insights.md (not the draft)

Write grep/glob/read output to `.skill-forge/insights.md` first.
Promote confirmed patterns to the draft only after review. This separation
prevents codebase content from being injected into every subsequent tool call
via the hook.

### Step 3: edit the staged SKILL.md

`init_staging.py` pre-wrote the skeleton at
`.skill-forge/staging/<n>/SKILL.md` — frontmatter with the three-clause
description stub and empty Prerequisites / Steps / Verification / Notes
sections. Use `Edit` to fill content; don't rewrite the layout. Bundled
helper scripts go under `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/scripts/`. CHANGELOG
lands at the target via `finalize_skill.py --changelog` in Step 5 — never
write it by hand in staging.

**Script over prompt for mechanics.** Every skill you design inherits this
rule: mechanical work — file paths, format templates, date stamps, version
numbers, JSON schemas, counters — belongs in a helper script, not in
SKILL.md. Prompt tokens are re-paid on every invocation and drift under
maintenance; scripts are tested once and stay deterministic. Push every
fixed-shape step into `scripts/` and leave only intent, judgment, and
decision criteria in the prompt. If you catch yourself spelling out a
literal block template, a bump rule, or a schema in prose, stop — move it
into a script and have the prompt call the script.

### Description writing rules

≤ 250 chars (Claude Code truncates from end — front-load distinctive keywords).
Skills only trigger for multi-step workflows (3+ coordinated actions); write
scenarios, not single verbs. Three-clause structure:

- **Use when `<specific multi-step scenario>`** — name real artifacts (file types,
  commands, frameworks), not abstractions. Replace vague verbs ("manage",
  "handle") with precise workflows.
- **Even if the user just says `<short phrase>`, use when they mention
  `<real phrasing>`** — pushy coverage for understatement. Claude undertriggers
  by default.
- **Do NOT use when `<simple/adjacent task>`** — list FP patterns explicitly
  (e.g., "simple file reads, single-step edits, code explanations"). Qualify
  keywords shared with unrelated tasks (e.g., "deploy" → "deploy with rollback
  and health checks").

Fewer starting errors = fewer optimizer rounds to converge.

**Instruction style: explain why, not MUST/NEVER.** Modern LLMs act more
reliably when they understand the _reason_ behind a constraint than when
they're handed a list of unexplained rules. Prefer "Write the config to
`<path>` so the reloader watcher picks it up without a restart" over "MUST
write to `<path>`". Rules divorced from their purpose break in edge cases
the author didn't foresee; rules with a rationale generalize.

### Step 4: grade via independent subagent

Spawn the `skill-grader` agent (the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type="skill-grader"`)
and point it at the staged draft: `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/SKILL.md`.
The grader returns JSON — parse `total` and `threshold_pass`.
See **Skill evaluator** for the rubric. Self-evaluating produces charity-biased
scores because the main agent has sunk cost in the draft; a fresh grader
context scores the text as written. Finalize only on `total ≥ 6`.

### Step 5: finalize (stage → real skill dir)

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/record_eval_score.py" <score>
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/finalize_skill.py" "<n>" --mode create
```

`finalize_skill.py` runs entirely inside a subprocess — `shutil.copytree`
moves the staged tree into `.claude/skills/<n>/` without going through
Claude's tool permission layer, so no prompt fires even on a brand-new
skill dir. The same script consumes the pending eval score, upserts the
registry, wipes `staging/<n>/`, and clears `.skill-forge/draft.md`. Offer
to run **improve mode** next to tune the description.

---

## Improve mode

Goal: iterate an existing skill — diagnose whether the issue is content, triggering,
or both, then fix accordingly.

`$ARGUMENTS` describes what to improve. Identify the target skill from the prompt
by matching against the registry (name, description, or intent). If ambiguous, ask.

### Step 1: initialize draft + staging

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/init_improve.py" "<matched-name>"
```

`init_improve.py` does two things in one shot: copies the live skill dir
(`.claude/skills/<n>/*`) into `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/`, and writes the
SKILL.md into the active draft. Every Edit/Write below lands in staging —
`.claude/skills/<n>/` stays untouched until `finalize_skill.py --mode update`
copies the finished result back atomically in Step 4.

### Step 2: diagnose (content vs triggering vs both)

**Content:**

- Trigger drift (too vague / too narrow), stale steps, missing edge cases, redundant steps.
- Bundling: 3 recent uses independently wrote the same helper? → move to `scripts/`.
- Anti-overfitting: is the fix generalizable, or patching one instance? Prefer reframing over more constraints.
- Version drift: assumptions still match current stack?

**Triggering:**

- Rarely auto-fires despite relevance? Uses complex multi-step scenarios? Pushy coverage? Has `Do NOT use when`?

Classify → 3a (content), 3b (triggering), or both (3a first).

### Step 3a: content improvement (patch-first)

1. Gather codebase evidence → `.skill-forge/insights.md` (low trust staging)
2. Promote confirmed patterns to draft
3. Apply edits to `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/SKILL.md` with `Edit` (not `Write`)
4. Run evaluator on post-patch version

**Bundling standard:** if the skill's recent 3 uses independently generated the same
helper code, that code belongs in `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/scripts/` — write once,
reference from SKILL.md. `finalize_skill.py --mode update` copies the whole
tree back, so new `scripts/` entries land in place automatically.

### Step 3b: triggering improvement (eval-driven)

1. Generate 20 trigger eval queries (10 should-trigger, 10 should-not-trigger).
   Save to `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/.opt/trigger_evals.json` — the `.opt/`
   dir is part of the staged skill, so it gets copied back to
   `.claude/skills/<n>/.opt/` by finalize and persists for future improve
   rounds (history, convergence flags):

   ```json
   [
     { "query": "<realistic user message>", "should_trigger": true },
     { "query": "<near-miss that should NOT trigger>", "should_trigger": false }
   ]
   ```

   Query quality rules:
   - **Should-trigger (FN)**: vary phrasing; include understatement ("just add a route" when full endpoint setup needed); include adjacent-skill competition; use real codebase artifacts (paths, commands, frameworks).
   - **Should-not-trigger (FP)**: near-misses sharing keywords but different intent — simple single-step tasks in the same vocabulary (e.g., "read the deploy config" vs multi-step deploy). Avoid irrelevant queries ("what time is it") — they don't test the boundary.
   - **Intent over keywords**: best negatives share 2+ keywords with the description but differ in complexity/intent. These expose overbroad triggers.

   Ask user to review before running.

2. Run optimization loop:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/optimize_description.py" \
     --skill-path ".skill-forge/staging/<n>" \
     --eval-set ".skill-forge/staging/<n>/.opt/trigger_evals.json" \
     --max-iterations 5
   ```

   Safe to point at staging: `optimize_description.py` only reads
   SKILL.md for the current description and writes opt_state.json next to
   it. The actual `claude -p` eval subprocess writes a throwaway command
   file into `.claude/commands/` with a UUID-suffixed slug, so there's no
   collision with the live skill that's still sitting in `.claude/skills/`.

3. Show before/after description and score improvement. Apply the winning
   description to `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/SKILL.md` with `Edit`.

   `opt_state.json` lands at `.skill-forge/staging/<n>/.opt/opt_state.json`
   with round history (FP/FN counts, best score, convergence flag) and
   gets copied back on finalize. Convergence = perfect train score (1.0).
   If FP/FN counts stall across rounds, stop early and report — the eval
   set probably needs sharper near-misses.

### Step 4: finalize (stage → real skill dir)

Re-grade the patched staged draft via the `skill-grader` subagent (same
agent as create mode). Then one command does everything:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/record_eval_score.py" <score>
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-forge/scripts/finalize_skill.py" "<n>" \
  --mode update \
  --changelog "<one-line summary: what changed and why>" \
  --bump patch   # or: minor (new capability), major (breaking change)
```

`finalize_skill.py` copies staging over `.claude/skills/<n>/`, bumps the
registry version, prepends a dated entry to `CHANGELOG.md` with the
computed version, consumes the eval score, wipes staging, and clears the
draft — one subprocess call, zero Claude tool permission prompts. Date,
version, and entry format are mechanical — never write CHANGELOG by hand.

**Patch vs rewrite:** `Edit` the staged SKILL.md unless >60% of content
changes; full rewrite is fine too, same finalize path.

---

## Auto mode (no arguments)

Fires after: 5+ tool calls, user correction mid-task, error recovery, or explicit
"remember this" / "save this workflow" / "make a skill" requests.

### Steps

1. Summarize the workflow just completed in 2–3 sentences.
2. Check registry — does an existing skill already cover this?
3. If not covered, ask via `AskUserQuestion`: "Reusable pattern: <summary>. Create a skill?" — options `Create` / `Rename` / `Skip`.
4. `Create` → run **create mode** (auto-name). `Rename` → plain-text prompt for name, then create. `Skip` → silent reset.

Skip if: task < 3 tool calls, pure read-only, or simple single-file edit.

---

## Skill evaluator

Scoring runs in the `skill-grader` subagent — fresh context, no sunk cost in
the draft, calibrated scores. Main agent does _not_ self-evaluate.

Invocation:

```
Agent tool, subagent_type="skill-grader"
prompt: "Grade draft at <absolute path>. Mode: create|improve.
         Write verdict to <output path> and echo to stdout."
```

Parse the returned JSON: `total` (int 0–8) is the decision key,
`threshold_pass` (bool) is true iff `total ≥ 6`. Rubric, scoring dimensions,
and the full schema live in `agents/skill-grader.md` — single source, don't
duplicate here.

**Threshold actions:** pass → finalize. 4–5 → revise once, re-grade. < 4
→ show the grader's `suggestions` and ask user whether to rework or abort.

---

## The 3-Strike error protocol

1. Read the failure, apply a targeted change to `.skill-forge/draft.md`.
2. Same failure → different phrasing / metaphor / structure. Never repeat.
3. Rethink scope — consider splitting into two narrower skills.
4. After 3 → share failures, ask user for guidance on scope or trigger wording.

Generalize from failures; don't patch the one failing case. A skill that passes
3 tests but breaks on the 4th real use is worse than one moderately good on all.

## File roles and trust levels

| File                                 | Trust | Re-read by hooks?     | Purpose                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `.skill-forge/draft.md`              | HIGH  | YES (every tool call) | Active skill being written |
| `.skill-forge/insights.md`           | LOW   | NO                    | Codebase scan staging      |
| `.claude/skills/skill_registry.json` | HIGH  | NO (loaded on demand) | Version registry           |
| `.claude/skills/<n>/SKILL.md`        | HIGH  | NO                    | Final persisted skill      |
| `.claude/skills/<n>/CHANGELOG.md`    | MED   | NO                    | Evolution history          |
| `.claude/skills/<n>/scripts/`        | HIGH  | NO (run on demand)    | Bundled helper scripts     |

---

## Registry format

`.claude/skills/skill_registry.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "skill-name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scope": "project",
      "created": "2026-01-01",
      "updated": "2026-01-01",
      "auto_trigger": true,
      "description_chars": 187,
      "eval_score": 7,
      "trigger_score": null,
      "usage_count": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

`trigger_score` is populated by improve mode. null = not yet run.
